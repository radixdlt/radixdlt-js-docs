  * ​[Reading and decrypting atoms from an owned address](atom-management.md#reading-and-decrypting-atoms-from-an-owned-address)​
  * ​[Caching atoms](atom-management.md#caching-atoms)​
* **Manage identities**
  * ​[Creating a remote identity](identity-management.md#creating-a-remote-identity)​
  * ​[Creating a simple identity](identity-management.md#creating-a-simple-identity)​
* **Manage transactions**
  * ​[Sending a transaction](transaction-management.md#sending-a-transaction)​
